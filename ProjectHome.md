This VST plug-in is an effector (VST-FX) using the Preisach model of hysteresis ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preisach_model_of_hysteresis)). The hysteresis distorts signals based on past input signals. This project aims various effectors including hysteresis.

Latest update:
IIR feedback was implemented.

Currently, the Î¼ (mu) function were approximated by an exponential function. This corresponds to the parameter labeled by "Hysteresis Param", and relates the degree of distortion. And the more strong input makes the more distortion.
